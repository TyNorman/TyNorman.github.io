# Portfolio website used to showcase my game development and web development projects. [tynorman.com](https://tynorman.com/)

I'm a Game Developer turned Web Developer with over 10 years of career experience across a multitude of contract projects. For most of this time I worked in the Games For Health space creating educational activities for youth in schools and hospitals.

Most of my focus has been in Gameplay Programming, UX, and Front End Development.

Lately as I enter a shift in my career goals I've picked up React, NodeJS, and whatever web-based development language looks like a good career fit.

I developed this portfolio site with React and deployed through Git Pages for hosting.

# Outside the Screen

Aside from games and programming, you can often find me taking up horseback riding lessons, learning how to vault on horseback, training inexperienced horses from the ground, and just generally at the barn.

I've earned my Equine Canada Level 2 certification and achieved Equitation - Champion in the Walk/Trot Adult Amateur schooling division for the Ottawa Area Dressage Group's 2024 awards.

Other than that, I enjoy cooking, baking, longboarding, and indoor bouldering.
